# WhatEvs Hangaburs: A Restaurant Satire Website

## Purpose
This is meant to highlight some of the basic concepts of a standard restaurant website such as viewing the menu items, adding them to a cart, and "placing an order".

## Concept
Users will be able to "login" to generate their own order. They will have access to view the menu items available and add them to their order. Once finished, they can then see their total along with the time required to prepare the food so that they know when to pick up their order.

All categories are built as objects that house menu items (also set as individual objects).

Further details can be found in the [**BuildNotes.md**](./src/assets/documents/BuildNotes.md) within the assets folder.

## History
Based off a play restaurant of my daughters, she had a difficult time saying the word "Hamburger"; however, this was one of her favorite meals as a toddler (still is actually).

I thought it would simply be fun to build out a page for a mock restaurant to highlight what a potential clients own page could look like.
